# Simple Android Flashlight App
This was a final project for my android developement class.
I created a simple flashlight as my final project.
There's a big button to turn on and off the flashlight and an option to change the background color of the app.
Feel free to download the APK on the right of the page!

Edit: Now you can download this app straight from the Google Play Store!
